# Lab 8 - A Dot product and a Matrix Multiplication in PyTorch and Tensorflow

1. Setup Tensorflow and PyTorch based on the instructions in `./setup/README.md`
2. Using PyTorch: 
  * Calculate the dot product between two vectors each of length 3 (1.5 points)
  * Calculate the matrix multiplication of two 2-dimensional matrices, each with a size of (2,2) (1.5 points)
3.  Using Tensorflow: 
  * Calculate the dot product between the same vectors as above (re-define them in Tensorflow) (1.5 points)
  * Calculate the matrix multiplication of the same matrics as above (re-define them in Tensorflow) (1.5 points)

Note: You can submit this as two separate notebooks and HTMLs, or as a single notebook and an HTML (if you choose a single notebook, you will need to switch between the PyTorch and Tesorflow kernels).
